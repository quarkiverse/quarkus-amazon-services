= Amazon API Gateway v2 Client

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

Amazon API Gateway v2 enables you to create, deploy, and manage WebSocket and HTTP APIs.

You can find more information about API Gateway v2 at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api.html[the Amazon API Gateway v2 documentation].

NOTE: The API Gateway v2 extension is based on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html[AWS Java SDK 2.x].
It's a major rewrite of the 1.x code base that offers two programming models (Blocking & Async).

The Quarkus extension supports two programming models:

* Blocking access using URL Connection HTTP client (by default) or the Apache HTTP Client
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/basics-async.html[Asynchronous programming] based on JDK's `CompletableFuture` objects and the Netty HTTP client (by default) or the AWS CRT-based HTTP client
