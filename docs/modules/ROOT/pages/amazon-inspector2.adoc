= Amazon Inspector Client

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

Amazon Inspector automatically discovers workloads, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and Lambda functions, and scans them for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.

You can find more information about Inspector at https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/[the Amazon Inspector website].

NOTE: The Inspector2 extension is based on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html[AWS Java SDK 2.x].
It's a major rewrite of the 1.x code base that offers two programming models (Blocking & Async).

The Quarkus extension supports two programming models:

* Blocking access using URL Connection HTTP client (by default) or the Apache HTTP Client
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/basics-async.html[Asynchronous programming] based on JDK's `CompletableFuture` objects and the Netty HTTP client (by default) or the AWS CRT-based HTTP client
