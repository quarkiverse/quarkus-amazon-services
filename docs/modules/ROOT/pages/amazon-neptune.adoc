= Amazon Neptune Client

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets.

You can find more information about Neptune at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/[the Amazon Neptune website].

NOTE: The Neptune extension is based on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html[AWS Java SDK 2.x].
It's a major rewrite of the 1.x code base that offers two programming models (Blocking & Async).

The Quarkus extension supports two programming models:

* Blocking access using URL Connection HTTP client (by default) or the Apache HTTP Client
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/basics-async.html[Asynchronous programming] based on JDK's `CompletableFuture` objects and the Netty HTTP client (by default) or the AWS CRT-based HTTP client
