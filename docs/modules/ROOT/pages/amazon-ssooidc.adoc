= Amazon SSO OIDC Client

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

Amazon IAM Identity Center OpenID Connect (SSO OIDC) is a web service that enables a client (such as CLI or a native application) to register with IAM Identity Center. The service also enables the client to fetch the userâ€™s access token upon successful authentication and authorization with IAM Identity Center.

You can find more information about IAM Identity Center at https://aws.amazon.com/fr/iam/identity-center/[the Amazon IAM website].

NOTE: The SSO OIDC extension is based on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html[AWS Java SDK 2.x].
It's a major rewrite of the 1.x code base that offers two programming models (Blocking & Async).

The Quarkus extension supports two programming models:

* Blocking access using URL Connection HTTP client (by default) or the Apache HTTP Client
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/basics-async.html[Asynchronous programming] based on JDK's `CompletableFuture` objects and the Netty HTTP client (by default) or the AWS CRT-based HTTP client
