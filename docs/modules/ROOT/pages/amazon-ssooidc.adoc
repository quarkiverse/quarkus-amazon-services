= Amazon SSO OIDC Client

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

Amazon IAM Identity Center OpenID Connect (SSO OIDC) is a web service that enables a client (such as CLI or a native application) to register with IAM Identity Center. The service also enables the client to fetch the userâ€™s access token upon successful authentication and authorization with IAM Identity Center.

You can find more information about IAM Identity Center at https://aws.amazon.com/fr/iam/identity-center/[the Amazon IAM website].

NOTE: The SSO OIDC extension is based on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html[AWS Java SDK 2.x].
It's a major rewrite of the 1.x code base that offers two programming models (Blocking & Async).

The Quarkus extension supports two programming models:

* Blocking access using URL Connection HTTP client (by default) or the Apache HTTP Client
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/basics-async.html[Asynchronous programming] based on JDK's `CompletableFuture` objects and the Netty HTTP client (by default) or the AWS CRT-based HTTP client


== SSO with the AWS SDK

The SSO OIDC token provider requires a synchronous HTTP client implementation.

If you only added an asynchronous implementation for your own code, you need to add to the classpath a proper implementation of the sync client. 

If you want to use URL connection HTTP client, add following dependency to the application `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>url-connection-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

If you want to use the Apache HTTP client instead, add following dependency to the application `pom.xml`:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>apache-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

If you want to use the AWS CRT-based HTTP client instead, add the following dependency to the application `pom.xml`:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>aws-crt-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Refer the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/get-started-auth.html[AWS SDK developer guide] to set up for authentication.
