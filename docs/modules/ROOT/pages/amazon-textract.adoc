include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

Amazon Textract is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to extract printed text, handwriting, layout elements, and data from any document.

You can find more information about Textract at https://aws.amazon.com/textract/[the Amazon Textract website].

NOTE: The API Gateway extension is based on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html[AWS Java SDK 2.x].
It's a major rewrite of the 1.x code base that offers two programming models (Blocking & Async).

The Quarkus extension supports two programming models:

* Blocking access using URL Connection HTTP client (by default) or the Apache HTTP Client
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/basics-async.html[Asynchronous programming] based on JDK's `CompletableFuture` objects and the Netty HTTP client (by default) or the AWS CRT-based HTTP client
