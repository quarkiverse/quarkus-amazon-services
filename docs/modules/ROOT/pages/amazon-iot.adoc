= Amazon IoT Client

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

AWS offers Internet of Things (IoT) services and solutions to connect and manage billions of devices. Collect, store, and analyze IoT data for industrial, consumer, commercial, and automotive workloads.

You can find more information about IoT at https://aws.amazon.com/iot/[the Amazon IoT website].

NOTE: The IoT extension is based on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html[AWS Java SDK 2.x].
It's a major rewrite of the 1.x code base that offers two programming models (Blocking & Async).

The Quarkus extension supports two programming models:

* Blocking access using URL Connection HTTP client (by default) or the Apache HTTP Client
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/basics-async.html[Asynchronous programming] based on JDK's `CompletableFuture` objects and the Netty HTTP client (by default) or the AWS CRT-based HTTP client
