== Named clients

NOTE: This feature is new and was initially designed to allow overriding credentials per named client. Feel free to open an issue to propose enhancements.

You can inject named clients with different configurations. To do this, annotate your injection point with `@AmazonClient`.

[source,java]
----
import io.quarkus.amazon.common.AmazonClient;

public class DynamoDbEnhancedClientTest {

    @Inject
    @AmazonClient("custom")
    DynamoDbClient clientNamedCustom;

----

Named clients inherit the configuration of the unamed client but you can override them.
